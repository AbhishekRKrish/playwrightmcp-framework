# Playwright with MCP Test Automation Framework

A comprehensive test automation framework that demonstrates the integration of Playwright with Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Allure reporting. This framework showcases automated testing of web applications using VS Code's MCP capabilities alongside traditional Playwright features.

## üåü Key Features

- **MCP Integration**: Utilizes VS Code's Model Context Protocol for enhanced test automation capabilities
- **Allure Reporting**: Detailed test execution reports with screenshots and traces
- **TypeScript Support**: Strong typing and better code organization
- **Page Object Pattern**: Modular and maintainable test structure
- **Parallel Execution**: Efficient test execution using Playwright's worker threads

## üéØ MCP Integration

This framework leverages VS Code's Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance test automation capabilities:

- **Accessibility Testing**: MCP provides enhanced accessibility snapshots
- **Semantic Understanding**: Better element identification and interaction

- **VS Code Integration**: Direct integration with VS Code's testing features- **VS Code Integration**: Direct integration with VS Code's testing features

- **Automatic State Management**: MCP handles browser state and context- **Automatic State Management**: MCP handles browser state and context



Example MCP usage in tests:Example MCP usage in tests:

```typescript```typescript

test('Search using MCP', async ({ page }) => {test('Search using MCP', async ({ page }) => {

  // MCP automatically enhances these Playwright commands  // MCP automatically enhances these Playwright commands

  await page.goto('/');  await page.goto('/');
